This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with the default options.

It demonstrates [this issue](https://github.com/seawind543/react-token-input/issues/114).

To see the problem, do `yarn build`.

The git branch 'dynamic' tries a workaround using next/dynamic but this also fails client side with a similar error.
